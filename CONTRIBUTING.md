# Contributing to the Agentic Development Guide


Thanks for contributing! To maintain quality in this open-source repository, please follow these guidelines and our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Language Structure

- **Concepts & Techniques**: We maintain English (`.en.md`) and Portuguese (`.pt.md`) versions. If you change one, please try to update the other or open an issue for translation.

## Adding Content

### Concepts (`concepts/`) and Techniques (`techniques/`)
- Use language suffixes: `filename.en.md` (or `.pt.md`).
- Use standard Markdown.
- Avoid "synthetic citations" (hallucinated sources); use real links.

## Pull Requests

1. Follow conventional commits (e.g., `feat: add new security skill`).
2. Ensure internal links differ correctly.
3. If adding a new concept, verify if it needs a link in `README.md`.

Your contribution is essential to democratize AI engineering!
